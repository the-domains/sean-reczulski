I've been meaning to make a website for awhile now. Sometimes you need something slightly more proper then Facebook or Twitter to share your story, so when I received a notification that I got access to The Grid's BETA test, I couldn't have been happier.

I backed this project in 2015 with the promise that it would change the way you design websites. No more picking colours, or wondering if that picture works with that theme. No, The Grid handled it all for you. Its promise was yo use AI technology to learn what you want and be adaptive in its layouts, colours, themes and styles. I signed up that day and after a few delays (c'mon its AI, no one was going to get it on the first try!) I'm in!!

I'll use this as my new home base for the time being, sharing articles, work related information and just things that I feel like sharing with whoever visits. So thank you for stopping by and taking this in and if you're wondering WHAT The Grid is and if this AI is more Allen Iverson (The Answer) or Terminator (Our End) check out this [video][0].
